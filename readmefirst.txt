I've completed both frontend and backend task.

Frontend - I've used react bootstrap for familiarity, whereas bootstarp has it's own property for "tr" in "table" so there is css for "td" in code. I didn't use any AI generated code for this.

Backend - all the APIs and functionality is working fine, if you find any error while using any, please do confirm me first. I've used ChatGPT generated code for "ejs" template.

P.S. - kindly connect with me through call, for further elaboration.
